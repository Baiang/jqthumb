It even works on IE6 from jQuery v1.8 and above.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$('img').jqthumb({\r\n    classname: 'jqthumb', // class name. DEFUALT IS jqthumb\r\n    width: 100, // new image width after cropping. DEFAULT IS 100px.\r\n    height: 100, // new image height after cropping. DEFAULT IS 100px.\r\n    img_src: 'src' // to specify the image source attribute. DEFAULT IS src.\r\n    showoncomplete: false, // TRUE = show immediately after processing. FALSE = do not show it. DEFAULT IS TRUE.        \r\n    eachcomplete: function(imgObj){ // callback when ONE image is cropped.\r\n        $(imgObj).fadeIn();\r\n    },\r\n    allcomplete: function(){ // callback when ALL images are cropped.\r\n        alert('Done!');\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with plugin?
